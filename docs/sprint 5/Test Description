You are a customer that is new to this website. You start by pressing the “Login/Register” button in the top right corner. You don’t have an account so you want to sign up by pressing the “Sign up” button. Enter your name, a username, your email address, phone number, a password and then repeat the password. After you have successfully done that, press “Create Account”. You have now successfully created an account. To check if the login information is correct, you can log out and log in again using the username and password you created. Press the “Logout” button in the top right corner. Press “Login/Register” and enter your username and password. Then press “Login”. Now that you are successfully logged in, you can book your first appointment. Start by pressing the “Book appointment” button in the middle of the home page or by pressing the “Book” button on the navigation bar. Then you want to choose Siggi Eiríks as your barber. Next you want to choose a service, in this case you want a haircut from Maggi. You try to pick a date in the past by selecting 12.10.2022 but the page displays an error message and tells you to “Please select a date in the future”. You try again and select 24.12.2022 but it is not available because of Christmas. The page tells you to “No appointments today, Aðfangadagur”. Finally, you choose the correct date by selecting 05.12.2022. The page displays available times and you select 12:00. You have successfully booked an appointment and the page gives you the information about your booking. You want to double check that you have booked the appointment. Press the “History” button in the navigation bar. The page displays the booking for you where you can see the service, price, date, time and days until the appointment. To change the time of your appointment press the “Reschedule appointment” button and choose the same date as before, 05.12.2022. Now you want to choose another time. You can see that 12:00 isn’t available because of your current booking you can change it to 10:00. You are navigated back to the history page and can see that the booking time has changed. You suddenly decide you want to save the money so you cancel the appointment. Press “Cancel appointment” to cancel the appointment. You need to confirm you want to cancel the appointment by pressing “OK” on the notification you get. The booking information has been changed and there is a description saying “Canceled”.  You get a notification in the top right corner. You hover over it with your mouse and see that it says “Your appointment with Siggi Eiríks on 2022-12-05 has been canceled”. We now demonstrate for you how Siggi Eiríks would use the website, so you can see the barber side of the system. You sign in by typing barber10 as username and password. You press “Dashboard” on the navigation bar and choose a date where you want to see your appointments. Select 05.12.2022 and see your appointments. You can then cancel the appointment, reschedule it or take a sick day. If you cancel, the customer gets a notification and the option description on the appointment reads “canceled”.  If you reschedule, the customer gets a notification that he needs to reschedule the appointment. Lastly if you take a sick day, all customers who have an appointment on that day get a notification and no one can book an appointment with you on that day. You decide to take a sick day on 05.12.2022 by pressing the “Take sick day”. The page then displays a message saying “No appointments today, You took a day off”. 


In conclusion, all the tests passed, though we found a few things that could be improved. The date format is inconsistent, sometimes it shows as dd.mm.yyyy, sometimes in reverse and sometimes the month’s name is written out. The notifications work but could work better, they sometimes stick around and ask you to reschedule even if you have canceled the appointment. A barber can make appointments themselves but can not add additional data about the person they are making the appointment for. This could be improved upon but is useful for phone call check ins.
