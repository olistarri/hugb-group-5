# First Lab Session
## Discord server
First we created a Discord server, so that we could communicate more easily.
## Gitlab
We created a Gitlab repository and forked the template repo for this course.
## Brainstorm
We did a brainstorm session during our first lab session. 
The initial ideas for the project were:
* Hairdressing salon / barber shop
* Car mechanic
* Psycologist office
* Escape room
* Car detailing
* Phone repair shop

In the end we decided to pursue the barber shop idea, and to create a system for booking appointments at a barber shop.
