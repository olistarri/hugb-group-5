# 06/07/2022 First group meeting in sprint 2
We started by randomly selecting the scrum master. Andri was selected.

We started by reviewing the user stories, adding four additional that we felt like were needed and then choosing 20, 17, 19, 15, 9, 7, 6 to attempt to implement during this sprint.
20: Create an account.
17: Book an appointment.
19: See different services available.
15: See all my previous bookings.
9: See price of the haircut.
7: Pick a specific barber.
6: Cancel an appointment.

Next we made implementable tasks from these user stories. The tasks are stored under issues -> boards -> sprint 2 backlog.

Next we made the definition of done. It is stored under issues -> tasks (which are the definition of done that we have to finish).

#08/09/2022 Finishing the definition of done.
We had a short Discord meeting about the definition of done, went over it and the scrum master turned it in for further feedback.
