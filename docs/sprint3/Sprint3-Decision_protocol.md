# 20/07/2022 First group meeting in sprint 3

We started by randomly selecting the scrum master. Arnar was selected. 

We then created a new backlog for sprint 3, called "Sprint 3 backlog".

First we created the definition of done for this sprint. For this sprint, our main goal is to create the barber UI but also fix and tweak minor things in the system. We will also be focusing on making the system dynamically populate appointment times, i.e. we will now be factoring in holidays, weekends, etc.

Then we populated the sprint 3 backlog. We added the user stories that are related to the barber accounts and also stories that are related to the history tab. We did not manage to finish the history tab (which show previous/upcoming bookings) in the last sprint, so we will now make sure that we finish it.
